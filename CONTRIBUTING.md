CONTRIBUTORS LICENSE AGREEMENT
==============================

By contributing your code to OpsMop you grant the Michael DeHaan LLC a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable, transferable license under all of Your relevant intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent, and any other rights), to use, copy, prepare derivative works of, distribute and publicly perform and display the Contributions on licensing terms of the current license.

Should Michael DeHaan LLC ever want to change the license to something new entirely, all contributors will be contacted with the email address stored in the git history. Contributors will have 30 days to agree or disagree. The license change may proceed if all contributors agree or the code for contributors who do not respond in the negative within 30 days is removed or replaced. We do not anticipate a need for this to happen, but may be required to, for example, move to a newer version of a license.

You confirm that you are able to grant us these rights. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for the Contributions.

You represent that the Contributions are Your original works of authorship, and to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or patent related to the Contributions. You also represent that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this license.

Michael DeHaan LLC acknowledges that, except as explicitly described in this Agreement, any Contribution which you provide is on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
